    <h1>Stock Close Price Prediction</h1>
    <p>This project implements an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for stock price prediction, deployed using Flask.</p>
    <p>
        The LSTM model is pretrained on four major stock tickers: <strong>Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG),</strong> and <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>. 
        For these stocks, the prediction process is optimized and ready to use. However, the app is designed to handle predictions for other stock tickers as well. 
        When a new stock ticker is selected, the app dynamically trains a new LSTM model for that stock. Please note that this process will take some time as the model needs to be trained first.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project demonstrates the integration of <strong>batch learning</strong> (pretraining on select stock tickers) and <strong>online learning</strong> (dynamic training on user-requested stock tickers).
